## Intro

*In this blog post, I will be examining the sleep data of mammals. Animals have always interested me, so I want to take a look at some characteristics of their sleep data. I will conduct this task by using both R and Python code chunks.*



## Code
```{R}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(reticulate)

msleep <- msleep
omni <- msleep %>% filter(vore=="omni")
```

```{python}
r.omni.sleep_total.mean()
```
*The average total sleep for omnivores in the msleep dataset is 10.925 hours. I used R and Python to calculate this value.*



##Reticulate
```{R}
part1 <- "Animals are"
```

```{python}
part2 = "so cool!"
print(r.part1, part2)
```
